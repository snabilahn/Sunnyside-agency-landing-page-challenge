# Sunnyside Agency Landing Page Frontend Mentor Challenge (Not done yet)

This project is a result of front-end mentor challenge that I made. I'm still working on responsive size for tab and mobile.

This project is built with:

- [HTML] - Standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
- [CSS] - Style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
- [Tailwind CSS] - Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
- [VS Code] - Code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
- [Google Chrome] - Browser built by Google

## Requirement
